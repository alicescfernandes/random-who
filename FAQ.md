Hi there.
So, i've made a FAQ because you may be wondering why i made this


### Why?
Well, when i first started random who, it was a project to learn how to use XML with Javascript. I was into to Doctor Who, and i wanted to do something with the show, and i ended up with a random episode generator. It had a ugly UI but it worked.  
As my knowledge grew bigger, i started to take this as an actual thing. I search for random episodes generator, and i found a few, but they were a bit ugly or didn't had all the episodes. And that's when i decided to work on this. This latest version is the one i ended up publishing mantaining (there is 3 versions avaliable)


### Why the Music?
Music plays such a big role on the episodes, it sets the tone for the scene, and gives more emotion to it. I think that the songs written my Murray Gold just fit the show, and fit the scene where they were used. Everytime i hear a song of the show, it just reminds me that one moment, that epic (or sad) moment of a certain episode. Take for example the episode "Doomsday" (Season 2, Last Episode) and listen to [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am7eHyJ8_1Y) or that one episode "The Husband Of River Song" and  [listen to this track](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47Jst07mNSU), doesn't that gives you chills. Music is just another piece that complete the episode, an important one. There is alot of covers for this songs online. 
**Attention: I do not provide copies of the tracks that i've used on the website**
